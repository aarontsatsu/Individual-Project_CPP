# Individual-Project_CPP

This program reads from an input file, an start location and destination.
The program uses breadth first search (BFS) to search for the various routes that can take one from the start location to the destination location.
The program, if it finds a solution, writes to a new output file, the routes it found.

To run the program, run the "FileReading" file as it contains the main method.
